# Build-Data-Dashboards-Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations-
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
## Flight Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data.
This datatracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015

You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:
### Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?

Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but you may choose an alternative visual to provide this information. Think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.
### What causes delays?

Think about if you work at an airline and you want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?
### You can also come up with your own question!

As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.

## Reminders
Your visualization work should use Tableau. Visualization should be explanatory in nature and communicate specific results that you want to show.

A PDF or Markdown report that includes the following sections:
Links to your dashboards or story
You must submit url links for each of your visuals from Tableau Public. If you need a reminder on how to save to Tableau Public, please see the next concept.
Summary: brief description of the visualization and the main story or findings conveyed
Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
Resources: list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, GitHub repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).
